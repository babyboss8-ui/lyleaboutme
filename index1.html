  <h1 style="color:white;">NARRATIVE</h1>
  <p style="color:white;">
    Hello my fellow wanderers, I am Lyle, a tapestry woven from various experiences, dreams, beliefs, and values. Born and raised in Dauis, Bohol, I carry with me the essence of this placeâ€”its culture, values, and the lessons it has taught me. This essay is a brief narrative of who I am, the path I've chosen to wander, and the aspirations that guide and push me forward.
  </p>
  <p style="color:white;">
    I would consider myself an ambivert more than anything. I really hate speaking in front of a big crowd, but I also enjoy the presence of others around me, talking and having conversations. I am a great listener, and that's where my introverted side comes out.
  </p>
  <p style="color:white;">
    Thirdly, I would describe myself as a very curious and wondrous person. I like to do things that other people haven't done yet and also do some research about that certain thing that caught my interest. By doing this, it satisfies my curiosity. Being a curious person is not a bad thing; it helps me develop my own understanding and perspective of the surroundings.
